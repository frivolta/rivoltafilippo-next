title: "Write better JavaScript, function composition with pipe andÂ compose"
---
In a previous article [link] I wrote about the concept of chaining functions using pipe and compose functions.
Today I would like to extend this topic providing you some scenarios where I found function composition can become really handy
in the everyday life of a front-end developer using React applying multiple Higher Order Components in more functional way!

## What is a Higher order function (HOF)
Before diving deep in Higher Order Components you should be familiar with the meaning of Higher Order Functions that we can
describe as a function that does at least one of the followings:
- Takes one or more functions as arguments
- Returns a function as its result

Let's take for example one of the standard ES higher order function you are probably already familiar with: Array.prototype.map,
it takes a function as an argument which is used as callback and applies it to every element of the array.
A very quick reminder: 
```
// Result is [2,3,4]
[1,2,3].map((number)=>number+1)

// Note that you can extract the callback function and pass it to the map function:
function addOne(arg){
    return arg+1
}

[1,2,3].map((number)=>addOne(number))
// or
[1,2,3].map(addOne)
```
We can now write a custom higher-order function: 
```
// We first define the function we will be using as an argument
const addOne = (arg)=>arg+1

// We than define our hof
const higherOrderFunction = (fn, arg) => fn(arg)*2
 
// The result will be 12
higherOrderFunction(addOne, 5)
```
Obviously this is a dead simple example but there are many applications for hof,
the benefit of this approach is that you can reuse the hof providing different operation functions, reducing
code duplication in favor of the single responsibility principle [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle].

## Higher order components with React
Higher order components are a very similar to higher order functions, here the definition from the React documentation:
"Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.".

[https://codesandbox.io/s/elated-colden-54c7wl?file=/src/withUser.js:0-147]

A simple example will be very useful here, let's first define a standard component that we will wrap later into a hoc:
```
// A page component that just render text
const App = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>A component</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
```
Imagine you want this component to be enhanced with some kind of information, in this very simple example we are
passing a custom prop, a static user that in a real application you want to be fetched in some way:
```
export const withUser = (Component) => (props) => {
  // Passing the user that you fetched 
  const currentUser = { authtenticated: true, email: "email@email.com" };
  return <Component currentUser={currentUser} {...props} />;
};
```
Now we can wrap the App component with our newly created HoC:
```
// A page component that just render text
const App = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>A component</h1>
      <h2>User: {props.currentUser.email}</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
// Wrapping with withUser function
export default withUser(App);
```
Every component in your application wrapped by the "withUser" HoC, will have the currentUser prop. If we have 
a very complex logic this could be a very good pattern to avoid code duplication.
You can have a look at a lot of real life example of this in the Klarna repository:
 - https://github.com/klarna/higher-Order-components

## Composing multiple HOC's

What if we want a Component to be wrapped by multiple HoC's? Well, here we have pipe and compose at rescue (they are explained in depth in my previous article: [link]).
Let's create another very simple HoC: 
```
export const withTitle = (Component) => (props) => {
  const title = "Custom title";
  return <Component title={title} {...props} />;
};
```
and wrap our two HoC's together (the compose function is a Ramda function, you can see the documentation here: [link to ramda] )
```
const App = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>A component: {props.title}</h1>
      <h2>User: {props.customUser.email}</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
export default compose(withUser, withTitle)(App);
```
I created a Code Sandbox so you can play around with the code: https://codesandbox.io/s/higher-order-components-54c7wl

## Conclusion

Higher-order components are really useful abstracting logic, for example most of your pages will have the same layout,
and maybe they share the same elements; they are easy to handle, and they make code more readable and they do not mutate the original component meaning they are pure functions.

During this post we have used very simple components in order to explain some complex concepts and share a pattern that you may found useful here you will find
some reference to go deeper in the main topics of this article:
